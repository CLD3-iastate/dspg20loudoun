      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

      <description>The NoVA area is composed by:
 City of Alexandria Arlington County City of Fairfax Fairfax county City of Falls Church Fauquier County Loudoun County City of Manassas City of Manassas Park Prince William County  The Social Vulnerability Index is created collecting several socioeconomic factors from the census tract data: i.e. the poverty, ethnicity, spoken language, household composition and crowdness, disabilities when present, housing type and access to transportation in the area.</description>

      <description>The regional accessibility indicator is created by examining the main sources of food supply within a specified radius. The three types of food sources analyzed are food retailers, farmerâ€™s markets, and food pantries.
To calculate a regional accessibility indicator at a census tract level, a center location must be determined. To find the center for each census tract, the geometric center of weighted by population density is used.

      <description>Project goals We have presented the food security of Loudoun from several aspects. Apparently, many of them are correlated with each other. In this session, we summarize all the metrics by creating a composite indicator. Essentially, it is a weighted average of all the previous variables. The weights is determined by Principel component analysis (PCA)/Factor Analysis (FA).
 Our approach PCA/FA groups together individual indicators which are collinear to form a composite indicator that captures as much as possible of the information common to individual indicators.</description>
