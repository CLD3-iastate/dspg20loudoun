The regional accessibility indicator is created by examining the main sources of food supply within a specified radius.  The three types of food sources analyzed are food retailers, farmer’s markets, and food pantries.

To calculate a regional accessibility indicator at a census tract level, a center location must be determined. To find the center for each census tract, the geometric center of weighted by population density is used.

Centers of Population for the 2010 Census. 
Retrieved from [here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/2010-centers-population.html).


For each census tract, only food supply sources within a specified radius would contribute to each census tract indicator.


Regional Food Accessibility = $\frac{\sum_{}^{} \frac{1}{distance}}{population}$

The summation of the inverse distances between each food supply source to the tract center was used to weight the closer food sources higher than those further away.

Lastly, the summation for each census tract is weighted by its census tract population to account for differences in rural and urban areas.
The results are regional accessibility indicators for each type of food source on the census tract level.


These indicators can help determine areas that likely require support to services such as food pantries, food banks and could potentially benefit from a local food hub.
