### Project goals
We have presented the food security of Loudoun from several aspects. Apparently, many of them are correlated with each other. In this session, we summarize all the metrics by creating a composite indicator. Essentially, it is a weighted average of all the previous variables. The weights is determined by Principel component analysis (PCA)/Factor Analysis (FA).

### Our approach
PCA/FA groups together individual indicators which are collinear to form a composite indicator that captures as much as possible of the information common to individual indicators. The individual indicators include:

##### Food access indicators:
- Food retailer access indicators
- Farmer's market acess indicators
- Food pantry acess indicators

##### Summary demographic variables from CDC SVI 2018 Data Dictionary:
- Socioeconomic index
- Household Composition & Disability index
- inority Status & Language index
- Housing Type & Transportation index
- Overall social vulnerability index

We standardized the variables first, then applied Factor Analysis. We kept three factors with highest loadings. Each factor takes 44.7%, 26.7%, and 7.7% of the overall variation, cumulatively 79%. Square of factor loadings represents the proportion of the total unit variance of the indicator which is explained by the factor. Thus, we take square of factor loadings as our weights.

The heatmap of the composite food insecuriy index is shown below:
