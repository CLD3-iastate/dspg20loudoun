### 2020 Loudoun County Project {style=text-align:center}

We partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension to identify areas where a potential food hub in Loudon County could alleviate food insecurity in northern Virginia.

### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

By identifying areas of food vulnerability and food outlets, we aim to help stakeholders identify neighborhoods where a Loudon County food hub could serve these populations.

### Our Approach {style=text-align:center}

Our research team used an interdisciplinary approach to combine datasets of publicly available economic and social information related to food insecurity. These data were used to construct a composite index of food insecurity at the census tract level. The composite index includes both demand and supply side factors influencing food security.
